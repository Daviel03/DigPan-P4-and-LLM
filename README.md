The Digital Pantheon-PROJECT 1 - LLM and P4 language

Our Objectives

Reproduce Net Prompt's P4 experiments end-to-end inside a test environment running in Mininet hosted virtually on Chameleon Cloud  so any classmate or reviewer can run them.


Quantify prompt-engineering impact by testing:
Role-based prompting
Meta-prompting (LLM creates its own prompt)
Iterative prompting


Benchmark three main LLM families—ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek—evaluating each of their available model variants. on:
Compile success (binary JSON produced, zero packet loss)
Iterations to success (prompt ➜ compile loop)
